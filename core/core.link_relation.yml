payment:
  description: 'Indicates a resource where payment is accepted.'
  reference: '[RFC5988]'
  notes: "This relation type registration did not indicate a\n      reference.  Requested by Joshua Kinberg and Robert Sayre.  It is\n      meant as a general way to facilitate acts of payment, and thus\n      this specification makes no assumptions on the type of payment or\n      transaction protocol.  Examples may include a web page where\n      donations are accepted or where goods and services are available\n      for purchase. rel=\"payment\" is not intended to initiate an\n      automated transaction.  In Atom documents, a link element with a\n      rel=\"payment\" attribute may exist at the feed/channel level and/or\n      the entry/item level.  For example, a rel=\"payment\" link at the\n      feed/channel level may point to a \"tip jar\" URI, whereas an entry/\n      item containing a book review may include a rel=\"payment\" link\n      that points to the location where the book may be purchased\n      through an online retailer."
